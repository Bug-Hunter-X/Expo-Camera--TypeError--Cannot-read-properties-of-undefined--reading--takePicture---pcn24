# Expo Camera Initialization Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API: attempting to access camera features before the camera has finished initializing.  The error typically manifests as `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'takePicture')` or similar.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation that uses the `cameraRef`'s `current` property correctly and handles the asynchronous nature of camera initialization using the `ref` hook and state updates.
