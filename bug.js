This error occurs when using the Expo Camera API and attempting to access the camera's features before it has fully initialized.  The component might render before the camera is ready, leading to a `null` or undefined value for `cameraRef.current`. This often manifests as a blank screen or an error related to accessing properties of a null object. For example: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'takePicture')`
